# SolaGriffin2024

This repository provides the data and code used to produce the results presented in Sola & Griffin (2024): Towards the resolution of context-dependency in local heterogeneity - diversity relationships: evidence from rocky reefs worldwide. 

Following a metanalytical approach, heterogeneity effects in rocky reef literature were analysed to assess the effects of heterogeneity facet, organismal group, environmental context and ecological processes on the strength and shape of HDRs. This approach allowed to develop an operational framework of heterogeneity metrics linked to multiple forms of heterogeneity at the local scale, or ‘heterogeneity facets’ (e.g., Heidrich et al. 2020). 

Here, you can find the code used to compute the effect sizes used in the metanalyses, the models run to assess heterogeneity effects, and the code produced to present model outputs in the Results section. 

To run the software, first download the data and run the code in the Data folder. All metadata can be found in the Metadata file therein. Once the effect sizes have been computed, you can run all the models within the folder Models – which are separated into Facets, Organismal Groups, Ecological Processes and Environmental Context. Finally, in the Plot folder, you can find the code to produce the plots used to prepare the figures in the Results section. Final figures can be found in the Figures Folder.

Note that the complete dataset and figures will be updated upon publication.
